#### INTRODUCTION 

Electronero Pulse  (ETNXP:)  

Electronero Pulse is  a  fork  from  Electronero  (ETN)  made  by  the  community,  for  the  community beginning building from Monero source v0.12.2 Lithium Luna, one of the most respectable cryptocurrency well-known for security, privacy, untraceability and active development. Starting as an educational project, we found that it would be great to create a new coin with high level of privacy by (1) moving forward right away to Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT), (2) setting minimum transaction mixins to 12 that would make it high resistance to blockchain analysis attacks..  We found that some of the features of Sumokoin were also interesting to us such as the "bitcoin-like" Camel emission, rather than a traditional Elliptical emission curve. So we implemented that. We also adapted the LWMA as we were advised by mathematician and blockchain theorist Zawy has researched this new difficulty algorithm extensively. Public Testnet launch is debuted at block height 280,000. The hard fork  will occur at block height  307,000  and  all  owners  of  Electroneum  will  be  de  facto  owners  of  Electronero.  The  codebase  for  this  project  is  the  Monero Lithium Luna v0.12.2+ release  core  code  to  which  a  lot  of  modifications  are  being  made  in  order  to  provide  a  better,  more  reliable  platform  to  current, past Electroneum and future Electronero  users. 


#### BASIS  FOR THE HARD  FORK 

Electronero core developers will begin by updating to fix ETNX supply, rewards, network fees. As a result of a world wide caucus held between the electronero core team. 19 members from different parts of the globe were selected as team after participating in volunteer conributions to the Electronero community. The internal reorganization brings with it some discussions and many votes were cast. The votes were split and two coins will be formed from the upcoming hard fork, which we will announce on BitcoinTalk at or around block 407,001. ETNX will survive a new birth. ETNXP, a segregated alternative and mineable token with chain specific parameters and a common goal will be formed on the Electronero blockchain. Estimated date of arrival for the hard fork is August 30th, 2018 in about two weeks, or 14 days. Meanwhile Electronero first Smart Node contract will be deployed soon to the mobile application, bear with us during development on that as we are rushing new features to market. Electronero core team will maintain both coins. ETNX coin will focus its usages to Smart Contracts and Mobile development, Applications, while the new Electronero smart node token ETNXP will be dedicated for Gaming, and Bounty. Any participating ETNX will be transferrable to ETNXP in 1:1 ratio for ETNX coins held in Electronero mobile wallet application or on TradeOgre.com ETNX wallets. We have support from Excoincial and TradeOgre at this time.  Stay tuned!
