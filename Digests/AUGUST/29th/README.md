#### INTRODUCTION 

Electronero Pulse  (ETNXP:)  

Electronero Pulse is  a  fork  from  Electronero  (ETN)  made  by  the  community,  for  the  community beginning building from Monero source v0.12.2 Lithium Luna, one of the most respectable cryptocurrency well-known for security, privacy, untraceability and active development. Starting as an educational project, we found that it would be great to create a new coin with high level of privacy by (1) moving forward right away to Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT), (2) setting minimum transaction mixins to 12 that would make it high resistance to blockchain analysis attacks..  We found that some of the features of Sumokoin were also interesting to us such as the "bitcoin-like" Camel emission, rather than a traditional Elliptical emission curve. So we implemented that. We also adapted the LWMA as we were advised by mathematician and blockchain theorist Zawy has researched this new difficulty algorithm extensively. Public Testnet launch is debuted at block height 280,000. The hard fork  will occur at block height  307,000  and  all  owners  of  Electroneum  will  be  de  facto  owners  of  Electronero.  The  codebase  for  this  project  is  the  Monero Lithium Luna v0.12.2+ release  core  code  to  which  a  lot  of  modifications  are  being  made  in  order  to  provide  a  better,  more  reliable  platform  to  current, past Electroneum and future Electronero  users. 


#### BASIS  FOR THE HARD  FORK 

Electronero core developers will begin by updating to fix ETNX supply, rewards, network fees. As a result of a world wide caucus held between the electronero core team. 19 members from different parts of the globe were selected as team after participating in volunteer conributions to the Electronero community. The internal reorganization brings with it some discussions and many votes were cast. The votes were split and two coins will be formed from the upcoming hard fork, which we will announce on BitcoinTalk at or around block 407,001. ETNX will survive a new birth. ETNXP, a segregated alternative and mineable token with chain specific parameters and a common goal will be formed on the Electronero blockchain. Estimated date of arrival for the hard fork is August 30th, 2018 in about two weeks, or 14 days. Meanwhile Electronero first Smart Node contract will be deployed soon to the mobile application, bear with us during development on that as we are rushing new features to market. Electronero core team will maintain both coins. ETNX coin will focus its usages to Smart Contracts and Mobile development, Applications, while the new Electronero smart node token ETNXP will be dedicated for Gaming, and Bounty. Any participating ETNX will be transferrable to ETNXP in 1:1 ratio for ETNX coins held in Electronero mobile wallet application or on TradeOgre.com ETNX wallets. We have support from Excoincial and TradeOgre at this time.  Stay tuned! 

**Supply & Emission**


Total supply ETNXP: 100,000,000,000 ETNXP token supply after the hard fork.

Coin symbol: ETNXP

Coin units:


electroneropulse = 1.00000000 ETNXP

tokenXP = 0.10000000 ETNXP

omegaXP = 0.01000000 ETNXP

alphaXP = 0.00100000 ETNXP

karmaXP = 0.00010000 ETNXP

shiftXP = 0.00001000 ETNXP

electronero = 0.00000100 ETNXP

noXP = 0.00000010 ETNXP



**Hash algorithm:** CryptoNight_MSR (CN_FAST, cn_variant 4)


**Block time:** 60 seconds



**Emission scheme: **Electronero Pulse's block reward changes every 6-months following a "Camel" distribution (inspired by real-world mining production like of crude oil, coal etc. that is often slow at first, accelerated in the next few years before declined and depleted). However, the emission path of Electronero is generally not far apart from that of Sumokoin.

#### TRUE FUNGIBILITY

Electronero is one of a few rare cryptocurrencies with true fungibility - the feature makes digital currency act like physical cash i.e. no other people can find where the money comes from and how many have been transferred.

#### GREAT PRIVACY

Electronero is created with high level of privacy in mind, setting Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) with minimum ringsize of 12(+1) to conceal sources/amounts transferred and make it high resistance to blockchain-analysis attacks

#### STRONG SECURITY
Electronero utilizes the power of a distributed peer-to-peer consensus network, every transaction is cryptographically secured. Individual accounts have a 26 word mnemonic seed displayed when created, which can be written down to back up the account and account files are encrypted with a passphrase to ensure they are worthless if stolen.
