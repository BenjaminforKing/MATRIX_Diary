### PEEPCOIN - PEEPMASTERNODE ‚ö°Ô∏è [20 : 1 SWAP][MASTERNODES] PCN can swap to PMN! üöÄ



#### What is PeepMasternode
The idea of making PeepMasternode is because there is a huge dump on the Peepcoin end of last month (June 2018) . We see that there is many Peepcoin hodler / investor who is shock about this issues. 

We're here to make things right. We believe, if we can make things right again the demand for Peepcoin will raise and it will benefit to the previous Peepcoin hodler and investor. We also believe the swap can make a dead coin, live again.


#### Who we are?
We're the SWAP-ECOSYSTEM team who also has invest a lot on Peepcoin. We welcome everyone who would like to contribute, advise and also take part on PeepMasternode.

#### SWAP RATIO
The swap ratio for Peepcoin to PeepMasternode is 20:1. Meaning 100 PCN = 5 PMN. Therefore to get 1 Masternode require 10 mil Peepcoin.

We only allocate 1000 PMN Masternode (500,000,000 PMN coin) for the swap. The swap period is 84 days before the actual reward distribution which will happen after block 100,000.
