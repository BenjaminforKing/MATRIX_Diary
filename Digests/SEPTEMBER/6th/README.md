### PEEPCOIN - PEEPMASTERNODE ‚ö°Ô∏è [20 : 1 SWAP][MASTERNODES] PCN can swap to PMN! üöÄ



#### What is PeepMasternode
The idea of making PeepMasternode is because there is a huge dump on the Peepcoin end of last month (June 2018) . We see that there is many Peepcoin hodler / investor who is shock about this issues. 

We're here to make things right. We believe, if we can make things right again the demand for Peepcoin will raise and it will benefit to the previous Peepcoin hodler and investor. We also believe the swap can make a dead coin, live again.
