#### OBJECTIVE

One of the well-marked objectives of Social Traders is to put an end to the scams in the world of cryptocurrencies. We all know that this is a perfect world for scammers since there are no such exhaustive controls. 

Anyone can create a false profile, attract investors and steal their money. Where will they claim? Who will be responsible? NO ONE. 
Our platform has 3 fundamental pillars,EDUCATION- SECURITY-INTEGRATION

####  WHAT DO WE REFER TO EDUCATE?
Social Traders will have a section where users can acquire all the necessary material to train as trading professionals. This section will have the necessary bibliography for you to analyze trends, learn about the    
indicators (how to read them, who was your creator, what other indicator is advisable to use, etc), establish your own investment strategies and enjoy this market so rich.


#### -SECURITY:
This is one of the most important aspects for us. At present, people are very busy with their family and work issues. For this reason, we will have a section of PORTFOLIO ADMINISTRATORS where those who want to        
invest their money and do not have time to do it on their own, choose among the different portfolios available, which will have labels according to the type of risk, and have all the information that we will recruit    
about said administrator (personal, fiscal, criminal, address, etc.). In addition to the administrator's data, you will be able to track the movements that are made within said portfolio.
