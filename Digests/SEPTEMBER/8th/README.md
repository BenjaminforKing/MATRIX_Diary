### BATMINER

#### AUTO REFERRAL & DYNAMIC POWER MINING SYSTEM

BatMiner – is a multi-pool with dynamic power distribution between users and automatic referral system. 

BatMiner can be used on computers, rigs, android mobile devices. Even the low-power devices are suitable. Our system recognizes the device power and sets the appropriate mining difficulty. At the same time, users can set any desirable difficulty by using appropriate port for connection.

New users will be automatically added to your network if you have registered an account and stay active for the last 3 days. The power of your device is also considered. You may also invite your friends to the network. Just send them your connection address and ask them to register on the web site. They in turn can connect another 10 devices. This way you have a small network consisting of 100 devices that can bring you from 20 $ to 1000 $ per month. The exact amount depends on devices power, cryptocurrency rates, mining network difficulty and other parameters.



Obtained profit calculation by example of small network consisting solely of mobile devices:

Suppose, you built 1 – 10 – 100 network with the average hash rate of 100 h/s for each node. In April 2018 such node’s power brings you about 0.00063 BTC or 5$ per month. So, for 10 nodes at the second level you get 10 * (20% * 5) $ = 10$ per month. For 100 nodes at the third level you get 100 * (20% * 5) $ = 100 $.  Suppose, your account has two private devices with the total hash rate 100 h/s. You receive 25% for them or 1.25 $ plus additionally 2% from the whole network. In total your income per month is 1,25 + 10 + 100 + (2% * 111,125) = 113,47 $. Note, all the work boils down to withdrawal of accumulated funds to your bitcoin or MXC wallet and checking application status on your device. Not bad? If needed, you can exchange the funds in Maxwell Wallet to fiat money.


According to statistics, each person has on average from 2 to 4 gadgets and the total number of mobile devices exceeds the earth’s population. Thus, we think that a network 1-10-100 is not big. Building such a network should be a relative simple task, if each BatMiner user could connect to his node devices from 10 people. 

Now imagine how much you can earn if you build a hybrid network consisting of mobile devices, computers and rigs.
